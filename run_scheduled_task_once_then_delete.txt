# SCRIPT NAME
$script = "c:\YourScript\script.cmd"
 
# CREATE SCHEDULED TASK
schtasks.exe /CREATE /F /TN "RunScriptOnce" /RU SYSTEM /SC ONSTART /TR "$script"
Start-Sleep -s 10
 
# TEST THE TASK
schtasks.exe /RUN /TN "RunScriptOnce"
Start-Sleep -s 10
 
# DELETE TASK
# this step would be the last step in the script.cmd
schtasks.exe /DELETE /F /TN "RunScriptOnce"
 

To turn this into a production ready process:

 

Step 1

Create the batch file

c:\YourScript\script.cmd

@echo off
:: add your code
echo do some stuff here > c:\YourScript\TheScriptRan.txt
schtasks.exe /DELETE /F /TN "RunScriptOnce"
exit /b 0


Step 2

Create the scheduled task

$script = "c:\YourScript\script.cmd"
schtasks.exe /CREATE /F /TN "RunScriptOnce" /RU SYSTEM /SC ONSTART /TR "$script"


Step 3

Restart computer


Step 4

Verify the script ran and the task was deleted

 

Notes

Something that is pretty cool, this process survives sysprep --- meaning, you could have a scheduled task run upon first login, perform some action items in the SYSTEM security context, and then delete itself; also works on cloud images.
