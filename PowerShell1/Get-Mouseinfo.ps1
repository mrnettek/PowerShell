.SYNOPSIS
    Uses Win32_Fan class to return information about fans in a system.    
.DESCRIPTION
    This script first defines some functions to decode various 
	WMI attributed from binary to text. Then the script calls 
	Get-WmiObject to retrieve fan details, then formats that
	information (using the functions defined at the top of the script.
